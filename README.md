UI for formatting and transforming structured data (**JSON, YAML**) using **jq** and `js-yaml`.

## Stack

- Docker image based on `node:24-alpine` with [`jq`](https://github.com/jqlang/jq) included  
- Express backend with support for **JSON** and **YAML** (via [`js-yaml`](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml))  
- Static UI served from `public/`  
- Exposed port: **8080**

## Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose

## How to run

Use the `Makefile` at the root of the project.

### Clean build
```bash
make build
```

### Start using an already built image
```bash
make up
# Open http://localhost:8080
```

### Stop
```bash
make down
```

### Run backend tests
```bash
cd backend
npm test

The test suite uses Node's built-in `node:test` runner.
It currently verifies:

- Normalization of spaces and tabs
- Consistent list formatting
